# Set tool

*Set tool* is a simple application that performs set operations.

## Usage

Paste a set A and set B into the form and click *Process*. The intersection, union and set difference (both ways) will appear in the relevant boxes.

Sets are represented as string lists. Each line is assumed to contain one element. Leading and trailing whitespace will be cleaned, empty lines will be ignored.

## Getting Set tool

Try the [Release folder](https://github.com/Superbest/set-tool/tree/master/Release).

If I forget to build after making a change, the Release build may end up behind. Debug will probably have the latest.

If all else fails, you can try compiling yourself. The solution was made in Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition.
