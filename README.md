# Set tool

*Set tool* is a simple application that performs set operations.

## Usage

Paste a set A and set B into the form and click *Process*. The intersection, union and set difference (both ways) will appear in the relevant boxes.

Sets are represented as string lists. Each line is assumed to contain one element. Leading and trailing whitespace will be cleaned, empty lines will be ignored.
